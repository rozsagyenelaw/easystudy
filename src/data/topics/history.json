The Sumerians developed cuneiform writing, the wheel, and the first legal code (Code of Hammurabi, c. 1754 BCE).\n\nAncient Egypt flourished along the Nile River. The pharaohs built pyramids, developed hieroglyphics, and created a sophisticated society lasting over 3,000 years. Key periods: Old Kingdom (pyramids), Middle Kingdom (expansion), New Kingdom (Tutankhamun, Ramesses II).\n\nBoth civilizations developed irrigation, mathematics, astronomy, and complex religious systems.",

The Roman Empire (27 BCE–476 CE) unified much of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nRoman contributions include roads, aqueducts, concrete, the Latin language (basis for Romance languages), and legal principles still used today.",
