All cells have a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and genetic material (DNA).\n\nProkaryotic cells (bacteria) lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells (animals, plants, fungi) have a nucleus and specialized organelles.\n\nKey organelles: nucleus (DNA storage), mitochondria (energy production via cellular respiration), endoplasmic reticulum (protein and lipid synthesis), Golgi apparatus (packaging and transport), ribosomes (protein synthesis). Plant cells additionally have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole.",

Each nucleotide has a sugar, phosphate group, and one of four bases: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C). A pairs with T, G pairs with C.\n\nGenes are segments of DNA that code for proteins. Alleles are different versions of a gene. Dominant alleles (capital letters) mask recessive alleles (lowercase).\n\nMendel's laws: Law of Segregation (alleles separate during gamete formation) and Law of Independent Assortment (genes on different chromosomes sort independently).",

Speciation occurs when populations become reproductively isolated.",
